# Sample Application With Deployment

Sample Application With Deployment is a test service tha returns information about user's birthday (how many days left to next birthday).  
This application has designed deployment/system strategy that you can find [here](docs/system.md).

To run application you will need:
 - [go](https://go.dev/) version 1.18
 - [helm](https://helm.sh/)
 - [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)

## Important Note
This repository does not include terraform deployment of atlas mongodb and AWS secret. I've created it beforehand and because of my illness (I'm still on the sick leave) I was not able to fully complete this task (what I planned to do).  
What I was planning to do, but wasn't able, was to create terraform scripts for atlas mongodb and aws secret.  
What is more, I was thinking about automating the whole stuff using Github Actions.  

### Development
The build is generated by make commands using [makefile](Makefile).

You can build project with:
```
make build
```
or execute tests with:
```
make test
```
or examine go code using commands:
```
make fmt
make vet
```
or, finally, create docker container:
```
make docker-build
```
To clean project from binaries and test files you can run:
```
make clean
```

### Deployment

You can deploy simple-application from your local environment using following commands.  
For linting and building helm charts you can use:
```
make helm-build
```
This command copies helm charts and overwrites {img} parameter, which is defined in Makefile.  

To deploy service to your local environment you can use (no need to run `helm-build` command before):
```
make helm-deploy
```
To delete helm deployment:
```
make helm-delete
```
